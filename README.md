## About Me

Chemist by training, environmental protector by trade, web developer by heart, and bird lover by nature - a full stack engineer looking to make the world better, little by little.

Studying as a chemist, and working in the environmental industry for almost 5 years gave me experience and knowledge that are both irreplaceable. But after 5 years, it’s time for a change. Switching careers to software engineering, I hope to bring the same values and experiences I’ve learned to coding. Stewardship, communication, and service are just a few of the skills I’ve picked up along the way, and these skills run deep, almost as deep as my love for bird-watching. I hope to bring that with me to coding as well - somehow, someway
