## About Me

Chemist by training and web developer by heart - a full stack engineer who just likes coding for fun.

Studying as a chemist, and working in the environmental industry for almost 5 years gave me experience and knowledge that are both irreplaceable. But after 5 years, itâ€™s time for a change. Switching careers to software engineering, I hope to bring the same values and experiences Iâ€™ve learned to coding. Stewardship, communication, and service are just a few of the skills Iâ€™ve picked up along the way, and these skills run deep, almost as deep as my love for bird-watching. I hope to bring that with me to coding as well - somehow, someway
